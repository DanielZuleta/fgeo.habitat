====

The goal of krig is to krig soil data as per John et al. (2007).

Installation
------------

You can install krig from github with:

``` r
# To install from a private repo, use auth_token with a token
# from https://github.com/settings/tokens. You only need the
# repo scope. Best practice is to save your PAT in env var called
# GITHUB_PAT.
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/krig", auth_token = "abc")
```
