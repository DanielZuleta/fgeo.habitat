# krig

The goal of krig is to krig soil data as per John et al. (2007).

## Installation

You can install krig from github with:

```R
# To install from a private repo, use auth_token with a token
# from https://github.com/settings/tokens. You only need the
# repo scope. Best practice is to save your PAT in env var called
# GITHUB_PAT.
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/krig", auth_token = "abc")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(krig)

# Using a randomized data set; useful for examples but not for research.
df <- krig::soil_random

result <- GetKrigedSoil(df, var = "M3Al")
lapply(result, head)
```
