# @section Interpretation of Output:

# `N.Hab.1`: Count of stems of the focal species in habitat 1.

# `Gr.Hab.1`: Count of instances the observed relative density of the focal species on habitat 1 was greater than the relative density based on the TT habitat map.

# `Ls.Hab.1`: Count of instances the observed relative density of the focal species on habitat 1 was less than the relative density based on the TT habitat map.

# `Eq.Hab.1`: Count of instances the observed relative density of the focal species on habitat 1 was equal to the relative density based on the TT habitat map.


# The sum of the `Gr.Hab.x`, `Ls.Hab.x`, and `Eq.Hab.x` columns for one habitat equals the number of 20 x20 quads in the plot.

# The `Rep.Agg.Neut` columns for each habitat indicate whether the species is significantly repelled (-1), aggregated (1), or neutrally distributed (0) on the habitat in question.

# The probabilities associated with the test for whether these patterns are statistically significant are in the `Obs.Quantile` columns for each habitat.

# Note that to calculate the probability for repelled, it is the value given, but to calculate the probability for aggregated, it is 1- the value given.
